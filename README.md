# Geolocation of Twitter Users by the content of their tweet











### High level description:

Text-based geolocation of twitter users: I plan to build a model to predict a twitter user's location based on the content of their tweet(s) and likely its associated metadata (timezone, timestamp, user-provided location, # of followers, # of tweets, etc.).

### Problem the model hopes to solve:

Twitter users provide a ton of free information in their tweets, including their opinions about certain products or political leaders, their health, or unique events they are experiencing. In order for some of this information to be useful it's also important to know the users location. For example, businesses or politicians might be interested in not only knowing what people are saying about their products or platforms, but how these opinions are geographically distributed. Additionally, public health experts might be interested tracking disease and then tailoring interventions for the areas of the country most effected.    

Unfortunately, only a tiny faction of twitter users have geotracking enabled for their tweets, meaning the above applications are very difficult. A predictive model to geolocate tweet users could greatly aid these endeavors.
